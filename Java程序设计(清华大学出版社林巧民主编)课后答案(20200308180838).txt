The occasion of the Spring Festival, my sincere wish that you and the families of the staff in the new year, good health, happy, happy2．变量的涵义是什么？变量名与变量值的关系？ 在程序执行过程中其值可以改变的数据，称为变量，它本质上代表了内存中的一小块空间。每个变量都必须有对应的名称来标识它，即变量名，而变量空间所存放的数据则称为变量值。  3．Java语言提供哪些基本的数据类型，为什么要提供这些不同的数据类型？ 布尔型：boolean 整型：byte、short、int以及long 浮点型（实型）：float以及double 字符型：char 数据类型代表了数据的存储格式和处理方式，虽然严格来说计算机只能识别“0”和“1”，但是，有了数据类型以后，计算机的识别能力就被人为扩展了，它能够识别整数、实数以及字符等。  4．赋值语句的涵义是什么?  数据传递。  5．数据类型强制转换的原则是什么？如何转换？  对于变窄转换，如long到short、double到float，或者不兼容转换：float到short、char到short等，则需要进行强制转换。  float f = 11.5;  short b ;   b = （short）f; （强制转换）  6．每一条程序语句都应以分号来结束，这个分号能否用中文输入模式下输入的分号，为什么？  不能。首先中英文输入模式下输入的分号是不同的，不但外观不同，其存储所需的空间也是不同的，Java编译器只能识别英文的分号，对于中文分号，将会报错。  第4章 1．假定乘坐飞机时，每位顾客可以免费托运20kg以内的行李，超过部分按每公斤收费1.2元，以下是相应的计算收费程序。该程序存在错误，请找出。  public class Test  {       public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException      {            float  w,fee;             //以下代码为通过控制台交互输入行李重量           InputStreamReader reader=new InputStreamReader(System.in);           BufferedReader input=new BufferedReader(reader);           System.out.println("请输入旅客的行李重量:");           String temp=input.readLine();             w = Float.parseFloat(temp);  //字符串转换为单精度浮点型           fee = 0;

The occasion of the Spring Festival, my sincere wish that you and the families of the staff in the new year, good health, happy, happyAWT组件大致可以分为以下三类：  （1）容器类组件  （2）布局类组件  （3）普通组件类 容器类组件可以用来容纳其他普通组件或者甚至是容器组件自身，起到组织用户界面的作用；布局类组件本身是非可视组件，但它们却能很好地在容器中布置其他普通可视组件；AWT提供了一系列的普通组件以构建用户图形界面，它们主要包括：标签、文本框、文本域、按钮、复选框、单选框、列表框、下拉框、滚动条和菜单等。 3．AWT提供的布局方式有哪几种？请分别进行简述。 （1）FlowLayout  FlowLayout是最简单的一种布局方式，被容纳的可视组件从左向右，从上至下依次排列，若一组件在本行放置不下，就自动排到下一行的开始处，该方式为Panel类和Applet类容器的默认布局方式。 （2）BorderLayout  BorderLayout布局方式的特点是：将容器划分为“东”“西”“南”“北”“中”五个区，分别为BorderLayout.EAST、BorderLayout. WEST、BorderLayout.SOUTH、 BorderLayout.NORTH和BorderLayout.CENTER，每个区可以摆放一个组件，因此最多可以在BorderLayout的容器组件中放置五个子组件，前面已提到过，该布局方式是Frame或Dialog容器类组件的默认布局方式。 （3）GridLayout  GridLayout布局将容器划分为行和列的网格，每个网格单元可以放置一个组件，组件通过add（）方法从上到下，从左至右顺序加入网格各个单元中，因此，在使用这种布局时，用户应首先设计好排列位置，然后再依次调用add（）方法进行添加。 （4）GridBagLayout  GridBagLayout是所有AWT布局管理方式中最繁的，同时也是功能最强的，这主要是因为它提供了许多可设置参数，使得容器的布局方式可以得到准确的控制，尽管设置步骤相对要复杂得多，但是只要理解了它的基本布局思想，就可以很容易使用GridBagLayout来进行界面设计了。 （5）CardLayout  CardLayout布局将组件（通常是Panel类的容器组件）象扑克牌（卡片）一样摞起来，每次只能显示其中的一张，实现分页的效果，每一页中可以有各自的界面，这样就相当于扩展了原本有限的屏幕区域。
